Project:
The project is to create a basic weather app using API to get the information and then deciphering it to display on the page.

I tried to include some learning from previous examples and use:
Webpack + perhaps some plug ins - yes webpack no (fancy) plugins
eslint -yes
prettier
form validation
babel
JSON - yes
promises
async function -yes
